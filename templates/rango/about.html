<h1>This is what it's all about:</h1>
<p>Perhaps he didn't believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true, he must have felt that he lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he saw what a grotesque thing rose is, and how raw the sunlight was on th scacely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about...like that ashen, fantastic figure drifting toward him through the amorphous trees.</p><p><strong>The Greate Gatsby</strong>, F. Scott Fiztgerald</p>
